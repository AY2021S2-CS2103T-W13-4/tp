### Glossary

Junior College (JC) is the post-secondary education level where students are preparing for university.
JC is also the high-school equivalent in other countries. Hence, JC teachers may be packed with consultation
schedules which can leverage our software.

**Mainstream OS**<br>
Mainstream operating systems are the current operating systems with a significant market share, namely Windows, Linux,
Unix, and OS-X.

**MSS**<br>
Main Success Scenario (MSS) defines the optimal outcome of our commands, i.e. in the case where no errors occurred.
