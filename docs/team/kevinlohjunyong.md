## Project: Teaching Assistant

Teaching Assistant is a desktop application used for managing contacts and entries for JC/Secondary school teachers.
The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created
with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 (tbc) kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **New Feature**:
   * I was developed the `DeleteContactCommand`, `AddContactCommand`,
     `DeleteContactCommandParser` and `AddContactCommandParser`, etc. I was
     also responsible for refactoring various files 


* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=KevinLohJunYong&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)


* **Testing**:
    
    * I did tests for add contact command and delete contact command parsers.
    i thought of how to write the code as elegantly as possible.
  
* **Documentation**:
  
   * I contributed to the developer guide by in the Delete Contact Command section.
   I wrote plantUML code to generate the Activity Diagram and Sequecne Diagram.

*  **Community**
